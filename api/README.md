# Facebook-level Webscaleâ„¢ API
By [November](https://www.github.com/November)

All commands should be run in this `api` directory.

## Setup
```sh
npm install
```

## Execution
After execution, the api can be reached at `localhost:3000/api/shitf`
```sh
nodemon bin/www
```

## Testing
Testing uses the [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) framework,
and should be installed as a dev dependency if it's not
already installed on your machine.
```sh
npm test
```

## Linting
We use [jshint](http://jshint.com/), and have the config files
already setup.
```sh
npm run lint
```
